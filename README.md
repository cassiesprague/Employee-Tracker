# Employee Tracker
![License: Apache](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Description
This application allows users to track and manage their employees through a series of questions that will display the information needed.

My motivation for this application was to easily view, add, and delete people from a database. Many companies with lots of employees need a way to track all persons and departments, so this application will help make that easier.
